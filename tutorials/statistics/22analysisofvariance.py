## circumstances where central limit theoremt doesnt apply, i.e., where large population is not available, one way analysis of varaice and krushkal-wallis test is employed. They test the difference of mean for two or more indepdent groups.

## idea of test is examine the ratio of variance between groups and s2residueal, a staticthat measure the variance withing the groups. if the ratio is large, means are distinct and we can reject null hypothesis.
