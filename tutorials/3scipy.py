##scipy-extension of numpy used for scientific and advanced mathematics algo and functions
## it contains mathematical integration, linear algebra, statistics, image processing, language integration.
## characteristics -  built in mathematical libraries, high level commands for data manipulation and visulatization, efficient and fast data processing, large libraries.

## widely used packages - cluster algo (pattern), constants (mathematical and physical), fftpack (fast fourier transform), integrate (ode), spatial, interpolate (smooth splines), IO input and output, linalg (linear algebra), ndimage (N-dimensaional image processing), odr orthogonal distance regression , optimize, signal processing signal, sparse for sparse matrices, weave for c/c++ integration, stats for statistics, special for special function

## integrate function used for integration

from scipy.integrate import quad


def integrateFunction(x):
    return x
