##scikit-learn and Machine learning

## Each day 2.5 quintillion data bytes is generated = 1hundred million blue ray disk = 4 eiffel towers
## Machine learn is a great tool to analyze data, find hidden data patterns, relationships and extract info to enable info driven decisions

## Machine learing terminology 
## records, samples, examples
## inputs, attributes, features
## output, labels, targets, answer

## machine learning approach - solve a problem  or anyalze a dataset
## first to understand the problem or dataset
## second extract features from the dataset
## idetnfy the problem
## chose the right model
## train and test the models
## strive for accuracy

## Understand the dataset
#education professional tranining hourly rate
  
## hourly rate = response or label
#education and professional training = features or attributes can be used as predictors
## observation or records are the numbers

#idenfity the problem type and learning model
## supervised or unsupervised problem
## supervised model, dataset used to train a model should have observations,
## features and responses. the model is trained to predict hte rig


## how it works - supervised learning model
## known data - observation records - features/attributes and response/label - Machine learning algo - predictive model
## unkown data - observation records -  features/attributes - predictive model - predicted response/label

## unsupervised learning
## known data -  observations records - features/attributes - the response or outcomes are not known.

## test, train and optimize
## only the supervised learning model can be trained
## two approaches : use two different dataset or separate a single dataset (80 percent to train, 20 percent to train)

## scikit is powerful and modern machine learning python library for fully and semi automated data analsysis
## efficent tools to idenify and organize problems
## freen and open datasets
## model persistence
## rich set of libraries for learning and predicting
## it helps data scientists organize their work throughout
## Approach : model selection-estimator object-model training-predictions-model tuning-accuracy
## Important points:
## create separate objects for features and response
# ensure features and response have only one numerical values
## features and response should be in the form of Numpy ndarray
## since features and response would be in the form of array, they will have size and shapes
## features are always mapped as x and response is mapped as y
